This repository contains a collection of web development projects that I am working on as part of my learning journey in web development. Each project is a hands-on exercise to practice and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

# Image Search Engine Web Application
This app allows users to search for and view high-quality images from Unsplash. It leverages the Unsplash API to fetch and display images based on user search queries.

# Movie Search Engine Web Application
This application utilizes the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch movie and TV show data, including images.
Please note that you'll need to sign up for a free TMDB account to obtain an API key, which is required to access their API.

# Calculator Web Application
This is a simple calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports only basic arithmetic operations. It doesn't include advanced functions, scientific calculations, or complex equations.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
